Version control system 
Repository is a folder where you load the current project
Github is an online platform where you host repositories whereas git is just a tool for you to do so.

git clone -> used to clone a github repoitory in your local machine
git add -> add is just add the changes and tells git that you have made some changes
git commit -> this is commiting your changes / this is saving the changes 
git push -> uploading your file to remote repository. 

commits can be viewed in github (there is a button to do so)

git status ... this tells what is the status of all the files in the directory.

What files are added what are commited is it upto date with which branch etc. etc.

git add is basically to add the files that you want git to track 

All of this is happening in the local directory, to make is visible in the remote repository , we need to git push it.

github push origin master 

here origin is self directory and master is the branch you wnt to push into
